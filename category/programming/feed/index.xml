<div dir="auto">There have many questions that have been asked &#8216;Why we learn to program&#8217;. So I decided I can share something that may be knowledge sharing and valuable instructions for someone.</div>
</div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<h5 dir="auto"><strong>Coding Journey as a Personal Interest</strong></h5>
<div class="o9v6fnle cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q">
<ul>
<li dir="auto">First, you have to make your mind if a coding journey is for your personal interest or for regular income. if you are in a rumor that goes that &#8216;Web development and Software development&#8217; use to learn for higher-income/salary and job in a multinational company, just stop coding right now. You should feel your own interest to make you eligible as a programmer.</li>
</ul>
<h5 dir="auto"><strong>Keep Learning</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">Second, always keep learning. Don&#8217;t waste your talent to complete it with a different theme template. It can be good for you if you have an idea about web design but it is very tough to get you to a pick mark where you want to choose yourself you are made of for it. I don&#8217;t say it for a framework it&#8217;s for theme builder and extra added plugin that you are using.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Steady and Slow Process</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">Third, try to solve the code in a steady and slow process When you are learning you can see someone who knows how to do this and that. Very fast in linked with the database and security protocol installation. Please don&#8217;t waste your time to see that, learn the code in your own way.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Maintain Code Structure</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">Finally, always your structure to learn the code. It will make your code simple and easy. For that, you can also build your own framework but it should look your way, and of course, security is a big issue for every programmer.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="o9v6fnle cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q">
<div dir="auto">Make sure you also know the cybersecurity and the ethical hacking process.</div>
</div>
<div class="o9v6fnle cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q">
<div dir="auto">So, put up your mind and get back to work. Don&#8217;t just say I am good at PHP, I don&#8217;t want to learn another language. But say if you want to keen about learning these sorts of coding language can easily make you a problem solver for this kind of application.</div>
</div>
<div class="o9v6fnle cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q">
<div dir="auto"></div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<div dir="auto">Happy coding | Keen to learn | Explore for doing more</div>
</div>
